## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis at scale using big-data tools. Leveraging the power of Apache Spark (via PySpark) and PySparkâ€™s machine-learning libraries, the goal is to ingest social-media or text-corpus data, process it, and build a model that classifies text by sentiment (e.g., positive / negative / neutral).

This aligns well with my data-science background (machine learning, NLP) and interest in scalable data-engineering pipelines.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- `tutorial_one.ipynb` â€” A walkthrough notebook covering basic PySpark setup, data loading, and simple transformations.  
- `spark_project.ipynb` â€” The main notebook: data pre-processing, feature engineering (tokenization, stop-words removal, vectorization), model training & evaluation (using Spark ML).  
- `AdvancedDB_project.ipynb` â€” Supplementary notebook (optional) showing advanced database integration (e.g., reading/writing from/to relational or NoSQL storage) and Spark SQL approaches.  
- README (you are reading it)

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Distributed data processing via PySpark â€” scalable beyond single-machine Python.  
- Text-preprocessing pipeline: tokenization â†’ stop-word removal â†’ TF-IDF / word-embeddings (as applicable)  
- Model training and evaluation using Spark ML components.  
- Integration with data-engineering practices: reading raw data, cleaning, transformation, model output.  
- Suitable for larger datasets than typical notebook-only workflows.
